# Deep Learning

Here I'll post tutorials and small projects that I completed/did. Sometimes I make some changes to the tutorial, for instance, I'd solve the problem in a slightly different way, or maybe re-explain the tutorial in my own way, or go a little bit farther than what the tutorial guided me to do.

### Happy Learning
